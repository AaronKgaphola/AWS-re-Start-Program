#  AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Practitioner learning repository!  


 I’m **AARON KGAPHOLA**, an aspiring **AWS Cloud Practitioner** passionate about cloud computing and continuous learning.  
I’m exploring how AWS services work together to build secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions in the cloud.  
This space documents my progress, notes, and hands-on labs as I build my foundational skills in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

## Modules Covered

##  AWS Core Services Explained

### [Compute](AWS%20Services/Module%202:%20AWS%20Compute%20Services)

* Compute is the processing power for applications.
* Examples I worked with: EC2 (virtual servers), Lambda (serverless functions)
* It is important because it determines app performance and scalability

### [Networking](AWS%20Services/Module%205:%20AWS%20Networking%20and%20Content%20Delivery%20services)

* Networking connects AWS resources securely.
* Examples I used: VPC, Route 53
* It is important because it controls traffic flow and resource communication

### [Storage](AWS%20Services/Module%203:%20AWS%20Storage%20Services)

* Storage is where I keep data, files, and backups.
* Examples I used: S3, EBS
* Storage is important because it provides durable, scalable storage for applications

### [Databases](AWS%20Services/Module%204:%20AWS%20Database%20and%20Analytics%20services)

* Databases store structured application data.
* Examples I worked with: RDS, DynamoDB
* They are important because they ensure fast, reliable data access for apps

### [Security](AWS%20Services/Module%206:%20AWS%20Security%20services)

* I used IAM to control access.
* I learned about roles, policies, MFA, and basic encryption
* Security is important because it protects resources and data
